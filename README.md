# PDF_DATA_EXTRACTION

The PDF Data Extraction Tool is a Python-based application designed to automate the extraction of data from PDF documents into structured Excel tables. 
The tool employs a robust methodology: it analyzes the Excel template to identify relevant column headers using ship-specific indicators, extracts text and tables from PDFs using pdfplumber, and applies regular expressions to accurately capture fields. Key features include a scalable design for processing multiple PDFs, a progress bar for user feedback, and a downloadable Excel file with structured results. The tool enhances efficiency in maritime data analysis, reducing manual effort and ensuring data consistency. Future enhancements could include support for multilingual PDFs.
